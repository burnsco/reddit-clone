A full-stack clone of reddit using React and GraphQL. React hooks, Apollo
client/server, styled components, refresh tokens and full JWT authentication are
some of the technologies used to make this project. Made it to learn how to make
an entire front and backend with the latest TECH.

[**Demo Website**]( site down at the moment --corey)

- Subscriptions (Posts and Comments)
- Create Subreddits 
- Vote on Posts

### 🔥 SETUP

**Create a Postgres DB.**

1. Local Machine
2. Heroku 
3. Google Cloud (Free Year (\$400 Credit))
4. MS Azure ( ^^ something like the above)
5. List goes on

**Create a Prisma Server**

1. Local Machine with Docker
2. Demo Server on Prisma Cloud
3. On Heroku (it can be slow, server sleeps)
4. Make a Linux VM and host on Microsoft, Amazon or Google

**Edit the config files to reflect your choices**

## 📝 Important Info

I'm using the old Prisma one for this project because it is the only one 
that supports subscriptions!

Have fun! 😉
